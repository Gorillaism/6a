## 1. Status of C version of the Ticket system
### What is the status of your ticket software?

1. Have you created a pseudo code of what the software should do?
2. Is it reading the files (flights.csv, booking.csv) provided by the arguments to your program?
3. Is the information about the flights and bookings stored in a data structure?
4. Does the software match each booking with a flight?
5. Does the software allocate seats on the flight?
6. Does the software print a ticket for each booking?
