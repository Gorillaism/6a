## Agenda
1. Status of C version of the Ticket system
2. C++ bare-bone example
3. C++ namespace
4. C++ input/output
5. C++ Class example
6. C++ Class Access



## 1. Status of C version of the Ticket system
### What is the status of your ticket software?

1. Have you created a pseudo code of what the software should do?
2. Is it reading the files (flights.csv, booking.csv) provided by the arguments to your program?
3. Is the information about the flights and bookings stored in a data structure?
4. Does the software match each booking with a flight?
5. Does the software allocate seats on the flight?
6. Does the software print a ticket for each booking?

After some C++ introduction, I want to review/help those out with troubles of
the C version of the ticket system.

## 2. C++ bare-bone example

### Minimal C++ program
```
int main(int argc,char **argv)
{ 
	return 0;
}
```
C is a subset of C++, any C program can be compiled with a C++ compiler.

C++ is a superset of C. It requires a C++ compiler.

### Hello in C++
```
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc,char **argv)
{ 
	std::cout << "Hello!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

## 3. C++ namespace
## 4. C++ input/output
## 5. C++ Class example
## 6. C++ Class Access
```
```
